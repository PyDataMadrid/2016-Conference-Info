# Notebooks and other materials for the Data Containers tutorial

You can get the latest release of the materials here:

https://github.com/FrancescAlted/DataContainersTutorials

Also, make sure that you have the next Python packages installed:

    numpy
    numexpr
    pandas
    bcolz
    tables (pytables)
    matplotlib
    psutil
    memory_profiler
    ipython_memwatcher

I recommend to use Anaconda to install most of the packages above, and for the software that is not in anaconda.org repos, just use pip, e.g.:

$ pip install ipython_memwatcher

and start by the different tutorials following the numerical order.

** Enjoy data! **
